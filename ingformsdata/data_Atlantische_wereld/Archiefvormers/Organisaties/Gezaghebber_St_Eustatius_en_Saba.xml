  <his_func>With the reorganization of the colonial administration of the Dutch Caribbean territories in 1828, St Eustatius and Saba were placed under the supervision of a Commander (commandeur), who presided over a municipal council. He was accountable to the Governor-General seated in Paramaribo. In 1834 he received the title of Director (gezaghebber). He presided over a Colonial Council which replaced the municipal council. On Saba the Director was represented by a Commander. In 1845 St Eustatius and Saba came under the administration of a Governor who resided in Cura&amp;#231;ao and was represented on each of the other islands by a Vice-Governor.</his_func>
