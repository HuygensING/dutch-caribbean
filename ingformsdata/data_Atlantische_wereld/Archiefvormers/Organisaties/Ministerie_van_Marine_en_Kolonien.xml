  <his_func>In 1808 a Ministry of the Navy and Colonies was established. At that time the only West Indian colonies still in Dutch possession were the three Windward islands of St Eustatius, St Martin and Saba. In 1810 these too were occupied by the British. That same year The Netherlands was incorporated into the French empire. The Ministry of the Navy and Colonies was continued in Paris until 1814 with a separate Division Hollandaise to the French Department of the Colonies. The only colony it governed was the Dutch possessions on the African coast.</his_func>
