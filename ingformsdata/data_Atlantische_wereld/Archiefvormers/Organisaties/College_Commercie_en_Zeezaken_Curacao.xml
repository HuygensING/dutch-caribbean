  <his_func>&lt;p&gt;In 1816 a Board of Commerce and Affairs of the Sea was installed on Cura&amp;#231;ao, entrusted with the administration of justice in cases regarding questions between ship owners, captains, and crews, and disputes concerning insurance, damage, etc. as well as cases in other questions up to an amount of 150 guilders or 75 pesos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board consisted of two members and was presided over by a Councillor of Policy. The members, who were to be merchants or persons with knowledge, were nominated by the Governor General. The secretary of the Court of Policy was entrusted with the board's administration. There was a possibility of appeal to the Court of Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1834 the Board was dissolved. Disputes regarding commerce and shipping were dealt with from that year by the Court of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;</his_func>
