  <his_func>The highest civil and military authority in the colony of Cura&amp;#231;ao and its dependencies, the islands of Aruba and Bonaire, was held by a Director, who usually assumed the title of Governor. The Governor presided over a council which was entrusted with the administration and civil and criminal justice. At the time of the West India Company (WIC), the Governor received his instructions from this organization after approval of the States-General. After the WIC was dissolved, the Governor fell directly under the supervision of the States-General. On Aruba and Bonaire the Governor was represented by Commanders. Between 1816 and 1828 the Governor had to account for his administration to the Minister of the Colonies and between 1828 and 1845 to the Governor-General of the Netherlands West Indian Possessions seated in Paramaribo. In 1845 the Director of Cura&amp;#231;ao became again directly subordinate to the Ministry of the Colonies.</his_func>
