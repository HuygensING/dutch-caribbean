  <his_func>Between 1828 and 1834 the administration of justice was entrusted to a Council of Civil and Criminal Justice. Three members of this council were commissioned for the administration of justice regarding minor disputes. In 1834 the Council was replaced by the Court of Justice of the colony of St Martin. All civil and criminal cases including cases regarding commerce and shipping were brought before this Court. The Court was also entrusted with the drawing up of deeds of conveyance of real estate and mortgage deeds. The administration of justice in cases up to 50 guilders was again entrusted to three members of the Court as Commissioners for Minor Cases. There was a possibility of appeal to the Court of Justice.</his_func>
