  <his_func>The States of Zeeland were the highest governing body of the region of Zeeland. The institution was established in Middelburg.&lt;br /&gt;Since the province of Zeeland had its own territorial and commercial interests in the Atlantic, especially on the Wild Coast, the States of Zeeland were directly involved in Dutch colonial policy. They gave instructions to the expedition of Admiral Crijnssen, employed by the Zeeland Admiralty Board, which resulted in the capture of Suriname (1667). In 1682 the States of Zeeland, under the pressure of the States-General, agreed to sell Suriname to the West India Company (WIC).</his_func>
