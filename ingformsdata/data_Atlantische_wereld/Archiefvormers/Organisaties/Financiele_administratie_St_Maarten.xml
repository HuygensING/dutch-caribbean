  <his_func>During the rule of the West India Company (WIC), the most senior member of the Council, the captain of the militia, was responsible for the financial administration. In 1796 a bookkeeper was installed. He ranked second to the Commander (commandeur) and had a seat in the Council of Policy. Other financial officers were the auction master, the collector of import and export duties and the warehouse master. The role of auction master was fulfilled by the secretary. In the Government Regulation of 14 September 1815, it was determined that the financial administration was the responsibility of an accountant (boekhouder), who ranked directly under the Commander, and held a seat on the Council of Policy. In the Government Regulation of 1833 the accountant was replaced by an administrator of finance, who was supervised by the Commander. A colonial receiver was entrusted with the tax collection.</his_func>
