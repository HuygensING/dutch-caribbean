  <his_func>The institution was established in Middelburg. The Office was also a registry board (1603-) and consisted of seven members. One task was to record and verify all patents. Due to the particularism of the Dutch Republic at the time, the province of Zeeland had its own colonial interests in the Atlantic, especially on the Wild Coast. The conquest of Suriname in 1667, for example, was an undertaking entirely financed and planned from Zeeland, while until the establishment of the Society of Suriname (1683), the administration of this newly acquired colony was supervised by the States of Zeeland. Hence the involvement of the provincial Auditor's Office.</his_func>
