  <his_func>&lt;p&gt;During the 17th and 18th centuries Cura&amp;#231;ao had only one council, which concerned itself with both government and administration of justice. In 1804 a first step was made to separate the political and judicial administration. Two members of the island's council were commissioned with the affairs of civil and criminal justice, assisted by a secretary. In 1816 a Court of Civil and Criminal Justice was established, consisting of a president and four Councillors, assisted by a secretary. The political government was no longer involved with the administration of justice. According to the government regulation of 1828, the Court of Civil and Criminal Justice consisted of a president and six members, two civil servants, two landowners and two merchants, assisted by a secretary. The Commissioner of Police acted as the Public Prosecutor. In 1834 the Court was dissolved and replaced by a Court of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;</his_func>
