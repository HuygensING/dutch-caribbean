  <his_func>&lt;p&gt;Since the conquest of Cura&amp;#231;ao, the government and administration of civil and criminal justice were entrusted to a council, presided over by the Director (Governor). The composition of the Council varied over time, but there was a maximum of seven members. Besides the highest civil and military authorities in the colony, representatives of the white population occupied a seat, usually some of the richest and most prominent citizens. After the first British interregnum (1800-1803), the government and administration of justice were entrusted to a Court of Policy and a separate Court of Civil and Criminal Justice, respectively. During the second British interregnum (1807-1816), the two councils were merged into one board, although the administrations remained separate. After the restoration of Dutch rule, two separate councils were again established. With the new government regulation of 1828, it was stipulated that the Court of Policy was to have four members, two civil servants and two citizens, and be presided over by the Director (Governor). A separate municipal administration (&lt;em&gt;gemeentebestuur&lt;/em&gt;) was established, which had to submit accounts to the Court of Policy. The Court of Policy acted as a court of appeal for the Board of Minor Cases and for the Board of Commerce and Affairs of the Sea. It also dealt with manumission and related cases. The Court of Policy was dissolved in 1834.&lt;/p&gt;</his_func>
