  <his_func>There was no public notary on Cura&amp;#231;ao. For most of the 18th century the notarial function was filled by the governmental secretaries or the first sworn clerks. Certain types of deeds, like deeds of conveyance of real estate, mortgage deeds, marriage certificates and sworn statements were drawn up by the Governor (until 1740) or members of the Council. Between 1738 and 1748 the fiscal (Public Prosecutor) was also permitted to act as a notary. During the British interregnums (1800-1803; 1807-1816) the secretary was an Englishman, but he was assisted by a Dutch clerk. In 1816 the secretaries of the Council of Policy and of the Council of Civil and Criminal Justice both acted as notary public according to their instructions. Deeds of conveyance and mortgage were drawn up by the Councillors of Policy. In 1828 the function of notary was filled by the secretary of the Council of Policy and two of his clerks. Conveyance and mortgage deeds were passed before the municipal government until 1834 and thereafter drawn up by two Councillors of Policy.</his_func>
